# Description
 A Python program that will extract or separate the even and odd numbers into different files from the main file, whose name is numbers.txt.

# Usage
This program has a main directory where the 20 integers are stored. From that directory, after running the program
it will automatically create the even.txt and odd.txt directories where the even numbers will be directly stored
in the even.txt directory, and the odd numbers from the main directory will go directly to the odd.txt file.

# Pseudocode
     # Open numbers.txt (read), even.txt (append), odd.txt (append)
        # Read numbers.txt line by line 
            # If even
            # If odd
     # Print the output
